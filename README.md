- 👋 Hi, I’m @Argyris36
- 👀 I’m interested in why we have emotions and mood and how these are generated in our brains and shaped by our society, culture and relationships.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all sorts of things, including how to be a better coder (a long-term project), understand the history of emotions, and be a good dad.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on understanding mood and emotions. I love inter-disciplinanry research. For example, I am starting a collaboration with computer scientists to model interactions between humans, and with historians to understand how concepts of emotions evolved and varied across time. Have a look here for some of our recent work and data: https://github.com/nimh-comppsych/example-data.git 
- 📫 How to reach me: write me an email.
